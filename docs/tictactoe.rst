2. Player moves: The human player uses X (blue) and always moves first. Click on any empty square in the 3Ã—3 grid to place your X.

Computer response: After your move, the computer (O in red) will calculate its optimal move and place an O after a brief delay.

Draw: If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
